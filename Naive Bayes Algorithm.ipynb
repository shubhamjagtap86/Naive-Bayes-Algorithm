    "According to the Wikipedia, In probability theory and statistics,** Bayes’s theorem** (alternatively *Bayes’s law* or *Bayes’s rule*) describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.\n",
    "Mathematically, it can be written as:\n",

    "* P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of observing A and B respectively; they are known as the marginal probability.\n"

    "- It is simple algorithm that depends on doing a bunch of count.\n",
    "- Great choice for text classification problems. it's a popular choice for spam email classification.\n",
    "- It can be easily trained on small datasets.\n",

Here we consider Bernoulli trails which is one step further and instead of \"word occuring in the document\", we have \"count how often word occurs in the document\" you can think of it as \"number of times outcome number_x is observed over n trails\".\n",
